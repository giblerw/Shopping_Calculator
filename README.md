# Rationalizer
### A *True Value* Calculator
##### Native iOS, Swift 4
> In today's society, time is increasingly more valuable than physical money. So why not find out how much your material desires are worth? Not in dollars, but in hours spent working for it. The functionality is simple: Enter your current paid wage, in dollars/hour. Next, enter the monetary value of the item you desire to purchase, then hit "Calculate". And just like that, the minimum amount of hours required in order to purchase the item is printed on the screen. This app is helpful in reimagining the true value of the dollar. Currency rates continuously fluctuate as global economies react to a culmination of the current driving forces; when it all comes down to it, our time, and how we choose to spend it should be our true "gold standard" of value. So let's price out our material desires in a new way. One that really means something; hours spent earning.
